Last time, we discussed the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning. This post will introduce a third type, called abductive reasoning. I also want to talk a bit about Ockham’s Razor. It's a useful tool, up to a point, but is also misused and misunderstood. So I want to find a way to use it that isn’t false or misleading.

## Abductive Reasoning: A Likely Story

I’d love to be able to move from inductive reasoning to deductive reasoning in a lot of cases. That is, I’d love to be able to take our educated, informed hypothesis and determine its actual truth. That requires determining what missing information “fills in” the gaps in our understanding. This, by the way, will be our focus for many posts moving forward.

So, if that’s what we want to do, how do we actually do it? I mean, we may not even recognize what those gaps are, so how can we come up with likely truths about those gaps? And even if we can, how do we check the potential truth of a provisional inductive conclusion? This is the process known as abductive reasoning; but that sounds a lot like grasping at straws.

Abductive reasoning doesn’t purport to find truth. It means trying to find the likeliest explanation for our situation, given what we know. Even here, though, some literature uses the word “simplest,” which is the source of a lot of trouble. An explanation may be simple, but false. For instance, it looks as though the sun travels across the sky during the day. For thousands of years, the "simplest" explanation was that it really does travel that way. That explanation worked fine, until we learned new things that contradicted it. At that point, salvaging the heliocentric model required lots of corrections and exceptions. Meanwhile, another explanation became "simpler." All that said, the fact that the heliocentric model was wrong didn’t mean it wasn’t simple. It just wasn't likely, given what we learned later.

You may still protest that switching “likeliest” for “simplest” doesn’t change things. However, “likely” is a measure of statistics and probability. “Simple” is a matter of subjective judgment, or preference. While we shouldn’t assume an abductive argument is true, we can check how well it fits our current data. If it fits better than the current model, we may want to accept it instead.

## Ockham’s Razor

Another pernicious problem stems from a misuse of the mental model known as Ockham’s Razor. People often believe this means “the simplest explanation of something is usually right.” That is absolutely not what Ockham’s Razor means. So what does it mean?.

Ockham’s Razor is a mental model that we can use to judge two explanations that fit our data equally well. It’s not telling us that something is correct. It's not telling us that it’s the simplest explanation (which doesn’t even mean anything anyway). It examines which explanation requires the fewest additional assumptions to be correct. It also considers whether the  assumptions an explanation does need are too extraordinary.

I realize I haven’t told you what Ockham’s Razor states. That’s because opinions vary about the wording, and that variation is part of the problem. Sources are actually a little spotty on how William of Ockham put it, back in the 14th century CE. I’ll give you three versions, in increasing order of my own preference. I want us to get to a definition we can actually apply without me feeling too weird about it. Here's the first:

> <i lang="la">Frustra fit per plura quod aeque bene potest fieri per pauciora.</i> (“It is pointless to do with many what can be done equally well with fewer.”)
>
> Iohannes Buridanus, <cite lang="la">Quaestiones in Analytica Priora</cite>

This comes from Buridan, a relative contemporary of Ockham, in his analysis of Aristotle’s <cite>Analytica Priora</cite>. Aristotle more or less stated Ockham’s Razor something like 1600 years before Ockham. Buridan’s quote means what we were saying: The fewer new ideas we need to explain a thing, the better. It’s good, but it’s not super useful, as it might value one ridiculous premise over two plausible ones. So, let’s go to our old friend Isaac Newton instead, who said in the context of natural science:

> We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.
>
> Isaac Newton, <cite lang="la">Principia Mathematica</cite>

He at least brings up truth here, which is helpful, but when we don’t know truth for sure, it can be a little tough to apply. Thus I prefer best the following, by Bertrand Russell:

> Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities.
>
> Bertrand Russell, <cite>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</cite>

I interpret “known entities” here to mean things that we can take as true to within some defined tolerance. Maybe they’re true, whatever that means. Maybe they’re very likely given all the evidence we have. Constructions made from known entities will be more reliable, and thus more preferable. If we don't or can't know whether something is true, we shouldn't rely on it. Nor should we trust something when we can't judge its likelihood from within our system.

## A Last Word

As usual, this has gone on way longer than I’d intended. But we now have some formal tools to evaluate things, and some principles we can use to judge options. We’re all set up now to get into assumptions for real. Until next time, happy thinking!
