excerpt: "Hello, and welcome to the first in what I hope will be a long series of posts about the structures and processes of critical thinking. Along the way, I’ll talk about the basics of argument structures, formal logic, statistics, probability, and many common logical fallacies, plus other stuff I haven’t thought of yet."

Welcome! This is the first post in a series of posts about the structures and processes of critical thinking. As of this writing, I have about 40 posts in mind; we’ll see how it goes. 

To understand the basics of critical thinking, we need a set of basic tools and definitions. People sometimes use the same words to mean different things, which can lead to confusion. Thus, I’ll strive to define any term I use, and I’ll maintain a glossary for easy reference.

First, we need to define what an argument actually is. When people use the word “argue” out in the wild, they tend to mean “fight,” which is not the sense we’ll use here. Think of argument more as debate, or, rather, advocacy. If I want to convince you of something, I need to not only express my opinion, but also support it with evidence. This structure is what we mean by the term argument.

Now, there are at least two potential issues with this:

1. People don't always state all the support for their opinions.
2. People sometimes support their opinions with evidence that might not be reliable. If our support is false, then whether the conclusion follows is not even worth answering.

Let’s deal with the second problem first. We’ll never get anywhere if we don’t think anything can ever be true. So let’s define a premise to be a statement that we will accept as true, even if in the real world that may be up for debate. We'll use premises as evidence to support our main opinions, called conclusions. Analyzing arguments thus means judging whether our conclusion is true  given our evidence.

(A side note here: We actually aren’t even judging truth in an argument. We’re actually testing consistency. We accept our evidence, and then see if our conclusion follows. It’s easier to call that idea “truth” for now, but I promise we’ll examine that distinction in the future.)

Now, back to the first problem. It’s possible that an argument may actually leave out important pieces of evidence. People have limited time or space in which to argue. Furthermore, they may believe that certain ideas or facts are obvious, or agreed upon, so they don’t say them. We call these unstated premises assumptions. The problem is, those assumptions might be unknown, or controversial. So even if we accept all the evidence, we need to check whether the assumptions are true as well. It’s as if someone told you the beginning of a story, and then jumped right to the end. You’d want to hear that middle bit to be sure everything follows.

The tricky thing here is that there are *always* missing pieces. What's even weirder, though is that the assumptions aren't mysterious, or profound. You don't have to be clever to find them (which is nice, since if you did, I wouldn't be able to find them myself). What makes assumptions difficult is that they’re often small, and basic. They're easy to overlook, even without realizing there’s something we’re overlooking. Thus, I’m going to cover several major types of assumptions, to show you how to spot them in your own arguments.

One last thing, and then I swear I’ll stop. Beyond conclusion, evidence, and assumptions, we'll also need some tools of formal logic. Thus, I’m going to take the next few posts to define those too. After that, we’ll get back to premises and conclusions and lots of assumptions.

Happy thinking!
