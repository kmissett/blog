Before we begin our discussion of arguments, we need to talk about the various types of reasoning. This post will cover the two most familiar types: deductive and inductive reasoning. They get confused for one another a lot, or, even worse, they’re not seen as different things at all. There's a third type as well, that's less known; our next post will cover that, among other things.

## Deductive Reasoning is Top-Down

The previous three posts on formal logic illustrate deductive reasoning. We accepted certain statements as premises, and tested new ideas using those premises.

For example: I accept that it’s true that being in PA means that I’m in the US. If I then find out that I’m actually in PA, I can deduce that I’m also in the US. Likewise, I accept the premise that being in Philadelphia means I’m in PA. So if I had discovered instead that I were in Philly, then I’d know both that I am in PA and that, by extension, I’m in the US.

This is the process of deductive reasoning. Simplified, to be sure, but for now it’s enough. We’re given a set of premises that we may be able to link together. We can then deduce that certain things follow from those statements and connections. This is what I meant above by “top-down”: We get these premises handed to us in advance, and everything follows. If A implies B, and B implies C, then believing those forces A to imply C.

## Inductive Reasoning is Bottom-Up

Unfortunately, in the real world, we generally don’t know the entire story. We're not given all the relevant premises; even worse, there may be relevant factors that we don’t know to ask about. So we can’t draw the kinds of definitive, always-never conclusions as before. All we can do is make informed judgments based on what we know at the moment. We use the best information we have and some sense of the likelihood of various outcomes. But we know that some future information may affect the likelihood of our conclusion.

Thus, judging consistency is going to be dependent on the truth of other unknown things. This is the realm of inductive reasoning, and it’s kind of a probability and statistics game. We’ll say more about that in the future, but I want to keep this a bit more basic for right now.

So to recap: deductive reasoning applies general premises to some specific situation. Meanwhile, inductive reasoning uses a specific situation to try to find general truth.

## Why This Difference Matters

Confusing these makes it hard to know what it means to trust some conventionally held truth. For instance, many people see science as deductive, uncovering reliable, unchanging truths. The problem is, that’s not what science does, or even tries to do. Science is an inductive process. Scientists constantly re-examine and test and refine their theories. Then, if new data arises that contradicts those theories, they try to find better theories to fit the data.

Another issue is with the word "theory." We often use the word “theory” in conversation to mean, “this is my best guess at the moment, but I’m not basing it on much.” That has very little in common with the more rigorous scientific definition of the term. A scientific theory is not something people are guessing at. Rather, it’s something that fits the data we have to hand, and that we test all the time. Theories can hold up to decades or centuries of testing and refining, and we still call them theories. Thus, don't assume that calling something a theory means there's not good reason to support it.

Consider Einstein’s theory of relativity. It's a refinement of Newton’s theory of gravitation that we learned in high school. (Recall: inertia, action-reaction, and all that). Scientists and mathematicians tested and accepted Newton’s theory. It prevailed more or less unchanged for over 200 years. In fact, it’s still good enough for most everything humans do.

But around the turn of the 20th century, cracks began to show in Newton’s theory. New data seemed to contradict what Newton had said in the 1600's. Albert Einstein figured out a way to describe this new data. Relativity shows that Newtonian physics is a good approximation for almost every circumstance. However, at certain extremes, that approximation breaks down. That's a far cry from Newton being "wrong," though.

My point is, after over 330 years of Newton, and over 100 of Einstein, we’re still calling all that “theories” and not "truth." Our modern world depends on Newton and Einstein, not to mention quantum mechanics. But science is inductive, so calling something “truth” should always be provisional. 

## A Last Word

I think it's important for us to be clear about the difference between these two types of reasoning. That said, there's still a third type, which attempts to connect these two. We'll cover that in the next post, since this one is already pretty long.

Until next time, happy thinking!
