excerpt: "Last time we talked about the two big types of assumptions: scope shifts and overlooked variables. For the next several posts, I want to start looking at some of the major subcategories of those two types. This time, we’ll look at two of the ways that unrelated terms can be associated: similarity and mutual exclusivity."

Last time, we discussed the two big types of assumptions. For the next several posts, I want to start looking at some of the major subcategories of those two types. We'll start with scope shifts, which relate pieces of the evidence and conclusion. This time, we’ll look at similarity and mutual exclusivity. Similarity is saying two things are alike in some essential way. Mutual exclusivity means that they can't both be true at the same time.

## Case 1: Similarity

The example we gave last time was an example of a similarity scope shift:

* Evidence: She likes mangoes.
* Conclusion: She likes papayas.
* Assumption: Mangoes and papayas are similar.

Note that the two things don’t have to be exactly the same, but they do need to be similar in some way. The author isn't saying the evidence and conclusion at random. The fact that the person in question likes mangoes is persuasive or suggestive to the author. If we learn that mangoes and papayas are similar, then liking one suggests one will like the other. (To the author, at least.) They didn't provide the link, but that doesn't mean they think there isn't one.

Note also that we don't have to have ever heard of mangoes or papayas in order for this argument to be what it is. (For the record, I hope you have. They're very good.) Also, whether we agree with the assumption is irrelevant to how the author argues. You might think that mangoes and papayas are very different. That doesn't matter to this process. We can still say that the author used similarity to construct the argument.

Of course, similarity alone isn't all that rigorous. It ventures pretty close to arguing via analogy, which is rarely valid. Similarity can be compelling, though, and can sometimes lead us in the right direction.

## Case 2: Mutual Exclusivity

The other major case I want to discuss today is that of mutual exclusivity. Two concepts are mutually exclusive when they can't both be true at the same time. That is, something about each contradicts or prevents something about the other. (You can think of this roughly as them being opposites, though that's not quite true.) Here's an example:

> People who major in math in college are deeply uncool.

The assumption here is that being a math major and being cool are mutually exclusive. I don't actually know whether this assumption is generally true. I was both a math major and uncool by any objective estimation, but my own experience may not be the best guide. That isn't the point right now (I'm not deflecting, I swear). The point is, that assumption is what the author must be using to make their case the way they did. 

## Final Thoughts

We don't need to go too much deeper into this right now. Basic definitions and building blocks are enough for the moment. We'll discuss the validity of these arguments in the future. (For instance, if I'm being honest, I like mangoes way more than I do papayas. Additionally, looking back, it may not have been my major that caused my lack of cool, but instead my time in the juggling club... I'm getting off track.)

Next time, we'll see two more Scope Shift cases — Part vs. Whole and Formal Logic. For now, happy thinking!
