We now begin our discussion of the evaluation of arguments in earnest. How do we evaluate conclusions in the real world when we have incomplete information?. First, we look at what we know (the premises or evidence), and what we’re trying to assess (the conclusion or claim). Then we try to see what’s missing between them (the assumption). That is, we try to determine what the argument is using to bridge the gap between what’s known and what’s unknown.

There is a systematic way to identify these assumptive gaps; in fact, they come in two major types. We’ll discuss them in broad strokes in this post. In the next 10 or so, we’ll go much deeper.

Note: I’m distinguishing here between assumptions and logical fallacies. Assumptions are the unstated gaps between premises and claims.  Fallacies occur when people misunderstand the gaps, or rely too much on their truth. In other words, assumptions are things that would have to be true to connect the dots. Presuming that those dots actually connect can lead to errors in thinking. We’ll come back to logical fallacies in the future.

## Related vs. Unrelated Things

So, forget all the formalism for a second, and imagine I give you two things to compare. (The things, of course, will be evidence and conclusion, but don’t worry about that yet.) Those two things will be either related to each other in some way, or else they won’t. Those are, obviously, the only two possibilities. If two things aren’t related, then they’re unrelated. This, I’ll grant you, is not profound. That said, the fact that this forms the basis of a lot of our understanding is profound.

So, back to our conclusion-evidence structure. Let's imagine one concept appears only in the evidence, and another only in the conclusion. Then the assumption must relate them. We’ll call this a scope shift. 

What if there isn’t a clear scope shift? What if all the evidence at least seems relevant to the conclusion? This often happens when the argument is explaining, recommending, or predicting something. Then the assumption is that what the argument posits is correct. Furthermore, nothing we’re overlooking causes a problem, or provides some alternative explanation. We’ll call this, somewhat uncreatively, an overlooked variable.

## Case 1: Scope Shifts

> She likes mangoes, so she likes papayas.

So, here we have our premise (she likes mangoes), and the claim that follows (she likes papayas). The woman liking the former persuades the author that the woman must like the latter. We want the evidence to lead to the conclusion being true, so mangoes must be similar to papayas in some way. That wasn't actually stated, though, so we have to assume it ourselves.

This is not an unreasonable argument, if you happen to know about those two fruits. That said, even if I invented the words “mango” and “papaya” right now, the assumption above would still be the link. (I didn't invent those words, by the way.)

Note also that we can’t  assert the truth of the claim. The conclusion could be wrong; i.e., the woman may actually hate papayas. We don’t know. But for the argument to be consistent, there must be a connection between mangoes and papayas. The conclusion is only true provisionally. That said, we can identify and evaluate the steps in the argument. If the stated premises and the assumption are true, then the reasoning is sound.

## Case 2: Overlooked Variables

> The sun and moon and stars all travel across the sky throughout the day and night. Thus, the Earth is the center of the universe.

The claim here, which we talked about last time, could have explained the evidence. It's consistent. To accept it, though, we need to know two things. We need to know that no other explanation could work equally well. We also need to know that we're not leaving out other facts that introduce a problem in the explanation. Of course, there is such data, and there is another explanation that fits the facts better. But the argument wasn’t illogical; it was just wrong.

Keep in mind: I’m not saying that people didn’t believe the geocentric model of the universe in good faith. I don’t think they were lying to other people, or to themselves. I’m saying that there was information that people either didn’t yet know, or didn’t include, in this worldview. If none of that information had been true, the geocentric model would have survived. 

## One final note about heuristics

One could use each of the examples above to illustrate the opposite type of assumption. Are we overlooking some difference between papayas and mangoes that breaks the link?. Also, there's a scope shift between “things traveling across the sky” and “the Earth not moving.” Scope shifts and overlooked variables are heuristics: mental models that help us reason. Different people may apply them differently, or even interchangeably. That’s fine. 

I want you to get into the habit of examining the underlying reasons why you believe things. That will help you understand why other people might believe the things they say. The template we use to reason it all out matters less than the idea that we should. If nothing else, it could lead to better empathy between people. 

Happy thinking!
